# openai_api_chat
A basic chat app that allows me to use OpenAI chat features via an API key.

## single_prompt_and_response
Basic script that allows you to get a single response from ChatGPT based on a string value. No command line interface.

## rolling_chat
Emulates the chat functionality of the OpenAI Web UI in the console, allowing you to have a rolling conversation with the AI where it remembers the conversation.

Key Differences to the web UI:
- Use your much faster API key
- Can use different language models
- Conversations are not saved

## Limitations
Does not support multi-line input from the user, and cannot render the markdown output.
